MOFA ( Ministry of foreign affairs) Saudi Arabia has established the counters within the premises of Ahwal al Madni offices. After receiving the birth certificate,  go to the MOFA counter for the attestation.

The fee is 30 riyals. You can pay the price in cash or through an online bank account. The whole process takes almost 15 to 30 minutes.

After the attestation, its time to visit the embassy of your country.
5- Visit The Embassy of Your Country To Issue Passport Of New Born.

Few embassies are providing an online appointment. For example, the Pakistani embassy books an appointment through its website. If you get it then, visit the embassy on the given date and time.

Submit the required documents ( copy of iqama, National ID, and passports of the parents). Few embassies may ask for the translation of the birth certificate from Arabic to their native language. So Arrange it as well.

The embassy will start the process of issuing the passport of the newborn baby.

Revisit to collect the passport. The whole process may take time between 7 days to 2 months. Once you have received it, now Its time to pay the dependant fee.
6- Pay Dependant Fee

Paying the dependant fee is easy. You can pay it through your bank account online. The system will calculate the cost from the date of payment until the expiry of the sponsor. ( for working women, the sponsor is mother, otherwise its father).

We are explaining the procedure for Al Ahli bank Customers. However, the method is almost the same for other bank account holders.

For Al Ahli bank customers, log in to Alahli online. Then select ‘Government Payments and Refunds.’ In Biller, select Alien Control. And in Service, Select ‘ Adding Dependent Born Inside Saudi Arabia’

Below The Government Payments, new fields will appear.

Select Iqama ID of the dependant and provide the date of birth of the newborn baby. The birth date is in the Hijri format in the al Ahli system. However, you can find it on the baby’s birth certificate.

Once provided all the details, click on ‘Request Payment Fee.’ The system will calculate the fee automatically and shows it on the screen. To pay it, click on ‘Proceed.’ On the next window, click on confirm. The system will pay the displayed amount to Jawazat for newborn baby.
7- Fill New Born Bay Iqama Form

Always fill the form with black ink because Jawazat instructs that. However, your HR department can also help you fill it using Muqeem ( Al ILM) portal.
